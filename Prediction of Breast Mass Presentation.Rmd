```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Dataset
-This application use the dataset "BreastCancer" from the "mlbench" r package.  

-The dataset has 699 observations of 9 variables.  

-The outcome is the variable "class" which classifies the breast mass as benign or malignant.  

-The other eight variables are histopathological descriptions.  

## Dataset

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(mlbench)
data("BreastCancer")
df <- BreastCancer[,-c(1,7)]
str(df)
```

## Prediction Model
-A prediction model was built using logistic regression.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
model <- glm(Class~., data=df, family=binomial)
```
-The application uses this model to predict the breast mass classification of future tissue specimen.

-The user selects the grade of each variable and the application produces an output which classifies the breast mass as "benign" or "malignant".

-The application is hosted at https://preciouseunice.shinyapps.io/dataproductproject/.
